# Describe the benefits of using cloud services

### High availability

High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.  Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).

### Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.

The other benefit of scalability is that you aren't overpaying for services. Because the cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use. If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.

Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.

### Reliability

Cloud computing has strong reliability due to its decentralized design. Through the global distribution of resources, even if a disaster occurs in one area, other areas can still maintain normal operation, and the system can automatically recover and continue to work.

### Predictability

The predictability of cloud computing allows users to use it with confidence, which can be divided into performance predictability and cost predictability.

- Performance predictability: Through technologies such as automatic scaling, load balancing, and high availability, the stability and performance of the system are guaranteed when demand changes.
- Cost predictability: Cloud computing can track resource usage in real time and predict future cloud expenditures through data analysis, helping users better plan and optimize resource usage.

### Support governance and compliance

Cloud computing helps ensure that all deployed resources comply with corporate standards and government regulations through templates, automatic updates, and auditing capabilities. Cloud platforms can automatically update resources to meet new standards and use auditing tools to detect non-compliant resources and provide remediation measures.

On the security side, you can find a cloud solution that matches your security needs. 

### **Manageability**

Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

- Through a web portal.
- Using a command line interface.
- Using APIs.
- Using PowerShell.
